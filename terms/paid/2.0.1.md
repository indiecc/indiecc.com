## Payment

All the licenses granted under these terms are conditional on payment of the _Price_.

## Scope

This license covers the _Software_ as it exists today, as well as any contributions the _Developer_ makes to the _Software_ in the future.  This license does not cover any contributions the _Developer_ makes to any future version of the _Software_ for which the _Developer_ sells separate licenses.

## Copyright

The _Developer_ licenses the _Customer_ to do everything with the _Software_ that would otherwise infringe the _Developer_'s copyright in them.

## Patent

The _Developer_ licenses the _Customer_ to do everything with the _Software_ that would otherwise infringe patent claims the _Developer_ can license or becomes able to license.

## Sublicensing

If the _Customer_ combines some or all of the _Software_ with other software in a larger software project, the _Customer_ may pass on their license rights, or sublicense, the _Software_ as part of their project, and allow further sublicensing in turn, under the following rules:

### Value

The project must offer significant additional content or functionality beyond that of the _Software_ alone.  End users must use the project primarily for that additional content or functionality.

### Maintenance

The _Customer_ may sublicense others to maintain their project, but not to use the _Software_ in new or different ways in that project, or to develop projects of their own.

### Purpose

The purpose of [Value](#value) and [Maintenance](#maintenance) is to prevent the _Customer_ from sublicensing others who should buy their own private licenses.

### Terms

[Sublicensing](#sublicensing) and [Notices](#notices), as well as warranty disclaimers and damages exclusions at least as broad as [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) and [Exclusion](#exclusion), must be part of the terms of each sublicense.

### Unlimited Projects

The _Customer_ may build, and sublicense for, as many projects as they like.

## Notices

In order to make sure that everyone who gets a copy of the _Software_ knows about the license terms for their use, the _Customer_ agrees to give everyone who gets a copy of some or all of the _Software_ from them, with or without changes, the text of this license and any free public license for the _Software_.

## Agency

The _Developer_ has authorized the _Agent_ to sign this license on the _Developer_'s behalf.  The _Agent_ is not a party to this license.

## Guarantee

The _Developer_ guarantees that they either own or have the rights to license copyrights in the _Software_.

## Disclaimer

<span class="conspicuous" markdown="1">With the sole exception of [Guarantee](#guarantee), as far as the law allows, the _Software_ comes as is, without any warranty or condition.</span>

## Exclusion

<span class="conspicuous" markdown="1">With the sole exception of [Guarantee](#guarantee), as far as the law allows, neither the _Developer_ nor their _Agent_ will be liable to anyone for any damages related to the _Software_ or this license, under any kind of legal claim.</span>
